This folder is intended to be my "draft-notes" or "notebook" about different courses/books that I am watching/reading or have watched/read.


The idea is to perform exercises or take notes here although the code related to specific topics will be clasified properly on my "Foundations" folder.


You might find material from some (but not limited) of the following courses:

	- Learn How To code: Google's Go (golang) Programming Language. By Tom McLeod.

	- Web Development w/Google's Go (golang) Programming Language. By Tom McLeod.

	- Web Authentication, Encryption, JWT, HMAC, & OAuth With Go. By Tom McLeod.

	- Head First Go. By Jay McGavren

	- Go Programming for Network Operations. By Tom McAllen.


NOTE: At least at this point, the content on this folder is not intented to be consumed by a third party. As a matter of fact, you might find it "messy" as this are pretty much my "personal notes".
