# go-lab


- go-lab is no more than my notes while learning/practicing about Go. (And maybe some other stuff but mainly around Go)

- You might find the content from this repo caohtic or messy. If so, please keep in mind that at this point I consider this repo no more than my notes while studing, so the main purpose is but to be consumed initially only by me.

- If at any point you find my notes useful (I do not think so XD), feel free to use them.

- If you see content that you consider is violating your Copyright, I do apoligize in advance and please, notify me as soon as possible for me to take it down. Again, this repo is NO more than my personal notes while practicing multiple stuff from different sources.
