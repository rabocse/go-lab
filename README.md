# __go-lab__


- go-lab is no more than my notes while learning/practicing about Go. (And maybe some other stuff but mainly around Go)

- You might find the content from this repo chaotic or messy. 

- If at any point you find my notes useful (I do not think so at this point), feel free to use them.

- If you see content that you consider is violating your Copyright, I do apoligize in advance and please, notify me as soon as possible to proceed to take it down. Again, this repo is NO more than my personal notes while practicing multiple stuff from different sources.
